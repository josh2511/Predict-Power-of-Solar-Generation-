# Predict-Power-of-Solar-Generation-

Humans have been harnessing solar energy for thousands of years—to grow crops, 
stay warm, and dry foods. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, more 
energy from the sun falls on the earth in one hour than is used by everyone in the world in 
one year.  

Photovoltaic systems have become an important source of renewable energy 
generation. Because solar power generation is intrinsically highly dependent on weather 
ﬂuctuations, predicting power generation using weather information has several economic 
beneﬁts, including reliable operation planning and proactive power trading. This sproject 
builds a model that predicts the amounts of solar power generation using weather 
information.

This project proposes a two-step modeling process that connect sun announced 
weather variables with announced weather forecasts. The empirical results show that this 
approach improves a base approach by wide margins, regardless of types of applied machine 
learning algorithms.
