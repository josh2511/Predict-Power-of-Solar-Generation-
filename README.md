# Solar-Power-Inverter

Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources, which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.
Solar power is the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity, either directly using photovoltaics (PV). Concentrated solar power systems use lenses to focus a large area of sunlight into a small beam. Photovoltaic cells convert light into an electric current using the photovoltaic effect.

Tacking uses of energy is essential nowadays as to for best use of  energy management by using data science skills to predict solar inverter power by studying various natural factors and atmosphere.

Studying climate factors which affect the generation of solar power and get more solar power generation by eliminating the problems
